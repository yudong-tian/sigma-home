Huan, 
   I managed to implement the .click to see time series. function in the Land Explorer. 
You can see my version at work here: 

http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/PMM/le/

You can download the source code: 

http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/PMM/le/src/src.tar

and the file .js-le.php. in it is the one that with this new feature. You can compare, 
copy and paste the relevant code into yours and it should just work.
